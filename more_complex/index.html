                    <h5>verse</h5>

                    stop; i know exactly what you’re thinking

                    the timing’s all wrong and the energy is way over the top

                    you know it’s tacky how i’m singing yet another sad song

                    cause i never found someone to make me

                    <h5>pre</h5>

                    feel the way you do

                    no one to let me win when we’re playing clue

                    i could spend my whole life pushing left and looking right

                    but i won’t ever find another you

                    <h5>chorus</h5>

                    so i would wait all night in the freezing rain

                    and i would cut my hair or change my name

                    and i will always feel the same i swear it’s true

                    cause all i need is you

                    <h5>verse</h5>

                    wait; i’m sorry i forgot the flowers i waited too long

                    and the traffic thing said i was running late

                    i got to thinking in the shower how you made me so strong

                    and i’ll never find a love to make me

                    <h5>pre</h5>

                    feel the way you do

                    no one to reel me in with a bird’s eye view

                    well i could spend my whole life pushing left and looking right

                    but i won’t ever find another you
